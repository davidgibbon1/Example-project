# Realtime Multicam Studio

A powerful desktop application for recording and streaming multiple camera feeds simultaneously with intelligent auto-switching and real-time effects processing.

## Overview

This project started when I needed a solution for creating professional-looking video content without expensive hardware switchers. The app can handle up to 8 camera inputs, apply real-time effects, and intelligently switch between cameras based on audio levels, motion detection, or manual triggers.

<Callout type="default">
**Key Achievement**: Maintained 60fps performance with 4K input streams while applying real-time effects using Metal shaders.
</Callout>

## Technical Challenges

### Performance Optimization

The biggest challenge was maintaining smooth performance while processing multiple high-resolution video streams. Here's how I solved it:

- **Metal Shaders**: Leveraged GPU acceleration for all video processing
- **Memory Management**: Implemented efficient buffer pooling to minimize allocations
- **Threading**: Used dedicated queues for video capture, processing, and output

### Smart Switching Algorithm

The auto-switching feature uses a combination of:

1. **Audio Level Detection**: Switches to the camera with the highest audio input
2. **Motion Analysis**: Detects significant movement in frame
3. **Face Detection**: Prioritizes cameras with detected faces
4. **Manual Overrides**: Allows user control when needed

```swift
func determineOptimalCamera() -> CameraInput? {
    let audioWeights = calculateAudioWeights()
    let motionWeights = calculateMotionWeights()
    let faceWeights = calculateFaceDetectionWeights()
    
    return cameras.max { camera1, camera2 in
        let score1 = calculateCompositeScore(camera1, audioWeights, motionWeights, faceWeights)
        let score2 = calculateCompositeScore(camera2, audioWeights, motionWeights, faceWeights)
        return score1 < score2
    }
}
```

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-Camera Support**: Up to 8 simultaneous camera inputs
- **Real-time Switching**: Intelligent auto-switching with manual override
- **Live Effects**: Color correction, filters, and transitions
- **Recording**: High-quality output in multiple formats

### Advanced Features
- **Custom Transitions**: Smooth crossfades and wipe effects
- **Audio Mixing**: Multi-channel audio with real-time mixing
- **Streaming Integration**: Direct streaming to popular platforms
- **Preset Management**: Save and recall camera configurations

## Results

The application has been used in production for:
- **Live Streaming**: Over 100 hours of live content
- **Video Production**: 50+ recorded sessions
- **Performance**: Consistent 60fps with 4K inputs
- **Stability**: Zero crashes in production use

## Lessons Learned

Building this project taught me valuable lessons about:

1. **Real-time Systems**: The importance of predictable performance
2. **GPU Programming**: Efficient use of Metal for video processing
3. **User Experience**: Balancing automation with user control
4. **Performance Profiling**: Using Instruments to identify bottlenecks

## Future Improvements

- **AI-Powered Switching**: Use machine learning for smarter camera selection
- **Remote Control**: Web interface for remote operation
- **Cloud Integration**: Automatic backup and sharing features
- **Plugin System**: Allow third-party effects and integrations
